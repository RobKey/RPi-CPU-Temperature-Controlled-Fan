# RPi-CPU-Temperature-Controlled-Fan
Raspberry pi 3 CPU temperature controlled fan</br >
tested on strecth, jessie and ubuntu mate with 5V and 12V external PSU</br >
Uses PWMLED function (pulse width modulation) a transistor, a resistor and diode to control fan</br >
min = on temperature, coff = off temprature min - coff, dcmin = minimum dutycycle fan will run at, max = </br >
